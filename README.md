# Parcel HTML Template

_Hit the ground running with a minimal, extendable template!_

# How to Use

You can use GitHub's template function, or download the source code as a zip and start working from there!

Once you have all dependencies installed (run `yarn`), run `yarn start` to see the website on your machine!

From there, it's up to you what to do!
